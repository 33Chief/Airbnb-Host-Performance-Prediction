# 🧠 Airbnb Host Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict which Airbnb hosts are likely to become “Guest Favourites.”

## 🔍 Overview
Using a dataset of 86,000 listings, the model analyzes host behavior, response metrics, and property characteristics to find what drives success.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- ROC-AUC comparison & visual analytics
- Feature importance insights for host improvement

## 🏆 Results
- **Best Model:** XGBoost
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.842  
- **Top Predictors:** Host acceptance rate, reply time, and response rate.

## 📊 Insights
Hosts with fast reply times, higher acceptance rates, and consistent engagement are significantly more likely to be marked as "Guest Favourites."

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter / VSCode
